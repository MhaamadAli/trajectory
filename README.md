This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Trajectory:
Start Nextjs app and API
create .env.local from .env.local.template
run: npm install

(if you're using your own pinecone db (using different pinecone key))
run: node pinecone/initPinecone.js

run: node index.js

Start Python parser:
cd python-parser-server 
python3 -r pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py --reload

Upload resume and see returned job titles (there are only 3 job titles in pinecone for now based on the pinecone/initPinecone.js and data/allJobs.json file)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
